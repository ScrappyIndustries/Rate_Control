### [Nano RC12-3](Nano/RC12-3)
- uses a Nano (with ENC28J60 Ethernet shield) & an on-board mounted Cytron for rate control
	- 1 or 2 [MD13S](https://www.cytron.io/p-13amp-6v-30v-dc-motor-driver) for rate control
- self assembled through-hole board, least expensive
- controls two rates
- can be connected to a relay module with a 20 pin cable or dupont connectors
- work switch
- pressure switch

- can control two rates and eight sections
	- 8 relays (SPDT 12V output)
	- (1) 5V or 12V analog (pressure) input, potentiometer adjustable filtering
	- (2) optically isolated digital (rate/pulse) inputs (5V or 12V)
- 3.3V I2C headers (Qwiic)
	- supports optional external RelayDriver5 I2C board
 - work switch
 - canbus
